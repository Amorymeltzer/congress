### Todo
- Figure out how this works...
- Map out gameplan for rewrite
- R or python for graphs?  Need to get in there

- 2000 election uses numbers from 1990, of course.  Tricky.

- Check hunt hill algorithm, etc, for accuracy
- Convert to .csv?  Or all .tsv?
- massHuntHill - Divide by Wyoming to get some measure of divisibility
- ie if everything divisible...
- Test suite ie confirm calculations match actual

### Gameplan
- Parse census data to count reps per state
- Parse per state election data
- Keep a record of actual results to compare to
- For every year and every size...
- Some metric for difference from actual
- How to get a three-dimensional graph?  Probably need python/R there...
- Option simulate senate increase
